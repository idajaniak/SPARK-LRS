# SPARK-LRS
SPectroscopic Automated Reduction Kit for the Low Resolution Spectrograph on the 2.4 m Thai National Telescope - a Python pipeline for automated spectroscopic data reduction of TNT/LRS observations.

## About
SPARK-LRS automates the reduction of data from the 2.4 m Thai National Telescopeâ€™s Low Resolution Spectrograph (LRS).
While it was originally designed for exoplanetary transits, it was expanded to provide a general framework for long-slit spectroscopy for both, single- and dual-target slit observations.

### Features include: 
- automated file recognition and sorting
- creation of master frames
- bias subtraction
- dark subtraction
- flat fielding
- wavelength calibration using HgAr, Ne or custom arcs
- sky subtraction
- cosmic ray removal
- spectrum extraction
- photometric light curve generation, normalisation and response correction

SPARK-LRS is modular and user-friendly, allowing any level of user intervention - from fully automated to step-by-step control.

For explanation behind commands and data reduction please see: [reduction with SPARK-LRS  step by step](docs/reduction_steps.md)
